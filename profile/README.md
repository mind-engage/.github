## What is MindEngage?
MindEngage is a web-based authoring suite that lets you **generate, edit, and publish** fully interactive courses using large language models (LLMs) with optional **RAG** over your uploaded sources. You can produce outlines, lessons, auto-graded quizzes, and embeddable 2D/3D/physics/ML **simulations**, then **export** to Google Classroom or as portable HTML5.

---

## Core Capabilities
- **Courseware generation:** Outline → lessons → publish, with audience/duration controls.
- **Quizzes & exams:** Bloom-aligned items (TF/Single/Multi/Numeric/Short Answer/Confidence-MCQ); auto-scoring HTML.
- **Interactive simulations:** No-code wizard for 2D/3D/physics/ML; returns self-contained HTML you can embed anywhere.
- **Diagrams & decks:** Generate block diagrams and slide decks from prompts.
- **RAG with your sources:** Upload PDFs/slides/text; cite and ground generations.
- **Export & publish:** One-click Google Classroom/Forms; or download an **HTML5 zip** to host anywhere.

---

## Key Modules
- **Course Builder** – Generate/refine outlines and full courses (Basic/Advanced/Enhanced accuracy; Enhanced uses RAG).
- **Quiz Builder** – Build assessments from lesson highlights; export as HTML or Google Forms.
- **Simulation Builder** – Create interactive 2D/3D/physics/ML simulations with live controls.
- **Diagram / Deck / Code / Explainer** – Visuals, slides, runnable code snippets, and concept explainers.
- **Standards Library** – Templates aligned to NGSS, ISTE, CCSS-Math, ABET, and 21st-Century Skills.

## Standards & Instructional Design
Use built-in templates for **NGSS, ISTE, CCSS-Math, ABET,** and **21st-Century Skills**. Customize fragments (Objectives, Practices, Modeling Tasks, Assessments), save and reuse them across courses.

## Roadmap (High-Level)
- [ ] Deeper LMS integrations (Canvas/Moodle)
- [ ] Expanded diagram/deck libraries
- [ ] More simulation presets (STEM & data-science)
- [ ] Fine-grained citation controls and rubric generation
- [ ] Organization-wide template/version management
